Ninevah,Mt. Holly,,7/15/2017,,,2,1,,1,"I saw two adult loons and a chick in the western and west-central part of the lake.  First I heard a call, then I saw one adult, then another call near the shore and when I kayaked over, it was the other adult (presumably mother?) with the chick. She would make a soothing sort of coo sometimes, a sound I'd never heard. Then they swam over to the other adult and after that they all swam together, except when the adults would dive and come up a distance away, then swim back to the chick. The chick took a couple of brief dives too.  They are so beautiful!  I was the only a human on the lake, privileged to be with the loon family."

I was unable to pinpoint their nest, but an artificial nest platform was seen in an area of Ricker Pond where loons nested in 2015 successfully. One adult ""hooted"" (sounding like ""woo-oo"") probably to the 2 juveniles; another time one adult rose out of the water and flapped its wings. One adult came within about 10 feet of a canoe with 2 paddlers. Weather was cloudy with sunbreaks and light airs to breezes; 60s air temperature (F)."
